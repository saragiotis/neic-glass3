# ReqHypo Message Specification

## Description

ReqHypo is a message generated by the output library. ReqHypo represents a
single detection information request made by the output library to glasscore
(specifically the HypoList class), and is used to request that glasscore generate
a [Hypo](Hypo.md) for the referenced detection. The output library utilizes the
ReqHypo message when generating publication output.

The ReqHypo message uses the [JSON standard](http://www.json.org).

## Output

    {
      "Cmd" : "ReqHypo",
      "Pid" : String
    }
```

* Cmd - A string that identifies that this message is a ReqHypo message
* Pid - A string containing an unique identifier of the detection to request.
