# Cancel Message Specification

## Description

Cancel is a message generated by the glasscore library. Cancel represents a
single detection retraction notification made by glasscore (specifically the
Hypo class), and is used to communicate the detection's retraction to the output
library.  The output library utilizes the Cancel message in tracking
and managing detections prior to publication output.

The Cancel message uses the [JSON standard](http://www.json.org).

## Output
```json
    {
      "Cmd" : "Cancel",
      "Pid" : String
    }
```
