## General Configuration
These configuration parameters define overall glasscore variables. All values
should be greater than zero.

* **MaximumNumberOfHypos** - The maximum size of the detection hypocenter list. Once the
maximum size is reached, glass will start expiring the oldest detections from
this list as new detections are made. This value is used for computational
performance tuning. Too small a value can impact glass association performance.
* **MaximumNumberOfPicks** - The maximum size of the input pick list. Once the maximum size
is reached, glass will start expiring the oldest picks from this list as new
picks are received. This value is used for computational performance tuning.
Too small a value can impact glass detection performance.
* **MaximumNumberOfPicksPerSite** - The maximum size of the per site pick list. This value is
used for computational performance tuning. Too small a value can impact glass
detection performance.
* **MaximumNumberOfCorrelations** - The maximum size of the input correlation list. Once the
maximum size is reached, glass will start expiring the oldest correlations from
this list as new correlations are received. This value is used for computational
performance tuning.
* **PickDuplicateWindow** - The time window (+/-) within which to consider a
pick a duplicate of an existing pick from the same station.
* **NumberOfNucleationThreads** - The number of nucleation/detection threads to run
in glass. This value should always be at least one. The upper limit depends
on local machine capabilities. This value is used for computational performance
tuning.
* **NumberOfHypoThreads** - The number of hypocenter location threads to run in
glass. In general this value should be equal to **NumberOfNucleationThreads** to
avoid race conditions. This value is used for computational performance tuning.
* **NumberOfWebThreads** - The number of update threads to run per detection web in
glass. If the number of threads is zero, glass will halt while the updates are
processed. This value is used for computational performance tuning.
* **SiteHoursWithoutPicking** - The amount of time, in hours, before a site will
be removed from the detection webs if a pick has not been made on that site. If
set to -1, sites will not be removed for not picking
* **SiteLookupInterval** - The amount of time, in hours, before a site will
request information via a SiteLookup message. A new site (previously unknown to
glass) will always request information once before this interval applies. If set
to -1, sites will not request information, even new ones.
* **SiteMaximumPicksPerHour** - The number of picks per hour, above which a site
will be removed from the detection webs  If set to -1, sites will not be removed
from the detection webs due to pick rate.

## Nucleation Configuration
These configuration parameters define and control glasscore nucleation and
association. All values should be greater than zero, but exact limits are still
being determined.

* **NucleationStackThreshold** - The default threshold that the bayesian stack
needs to exceed for a nucleation to be declared. This threshold is also used to
cancel a previously nucleated hypocenter. This value can be overridden in a
detection grid (Web).
* **NucleationDataThreshold** - The default threshold that the number of supporting  
data (eg. Picks, Correlations) must exceed for a nucleation to be declared.  
This threshold is also used to cancel a previously nucleated hypocenter. This
value can be overridden in a detection grid (Web).
* **AssociationStandardDeviationCutoff** - The cutoff threshold in terms of number
of standard deviations for associating data (eg. Picks) with a hypocenter. The
standard deviation is fixed to 1.
* **PruningStandardDeviationCutoff** - The cutoff threshold in terms of number
of standard deviations for pruning data (eg. Picks) from a hypocenter. The
standard deviation is fixed to 1.
* **PickAffinityExponentialFactor** - The exponential factor used when calculating the affinity of
a pick with a hypocenter. **This value has little effect and likely does not need
to be changed.**
* **DistanceCutoffFactor** - The factor, used with the distance cutoff ratio to
calculate a hypocenter's association distance cutoff, i.e the distance beyond
which data (eg. Picks) will not be associated.
* **DistanceCutoffRatio** - The ratio, used with the distance cutoff factor to
calculate a hypocenter's association distance cutoff, i.e the distance beyond
which data (eg. Picks) will not be associated.
* **DistanceCutoffMinimum** - The hypocenter's minimum association distance cutoff.
* **HypoProcessCountLimit** - The maximum number of processing cycles a hypocenter can run
without having new data associated.
* **CorrelationTimeWindow** - The time window (+/-) used to check for duplicate
correlations and to associate a correlation with an existing hypocenter.
* **CorrelationDistanceWindow** - The distance window (+/-) used to check for
duplicate correlations and to associate a correlation with an existing
hypocenter.
* **CorrelationCancelAge** - The minimum age of a correlations before allowing a
hypocenter to cancel.
* **HypocenterTimeWindow** - The time window (+/-) used to check for mergeable
hypocenters in seconds.
* **HypocenterDistanceWindow** - The distance window (+/-) used to check for
mergeable hypocenters in degrees.
* **ReportingStackThreshold** The viability threshold needed to exceed to report a
hypocenter. Defaults to **NucleationStackThreshold**.
* **ReportingDataThreshold** The default number of data that need to be associated to report
a hypocenter. Defaults to **NucleationDataThreshold**.
* **EventFragmentDepthThreshold** The depth threshold for declaring a hypo an
event fragment, in combination with  **EventFragmentAzimuthThreshold**.
* **EventFragmentAzimuthThreshold** The azimuth threshold for declaring a hypo an
event fragment, in combination with **EventFragmentDepthThreshold**.

### DefaultNucleationPhase
This parameter defines the default nucleation phase for glass. This value can be
overridden in a detection grid (Web) if provided as part of a specific grid
configuration.
* **PhaseName** - The name of the default nucleation phase
* **TravFile** - The path to the travel-time lookup file for the default
nucleation phase.

### Association Phases
A list of phases to use for association.
* **PhaseName** - The name of the association phase
* **Assoc** - The association range [Minimum, Maximum] for this phase.  Mutually
exclusive with **Range**
* **Range** - The association taper [Start, RampUpEnd, RampDownStart, End] for
this association phase.  Mutually exclusive with **Assoc**
* **TravFile** - The path to the travel-time lookup file for the association
phase.

## Grid Configuration
GLASS 3 uses detection grids (or webs) of nodes to nucleate detections. In
general, there are two types of grids, Regional/Local grids, and Global grids.

## General Parameters
These configuration parameters are common to all GLASS 3 Detection grids.

* **Name** - The name of this detection grid
* **NucleationStackThreshold** - The viability threshold needed to exceed for a nucleation in a
grid to be successful.  Overrides the default **NucleationStackThreshold** in Nucleation
Parameters
* **NucleationDataThreshold** - The default number of data that need to be gathered for a
nucleation in a grid to be successful.  Overrides the default **NucleationDataThreshold** in
Nucleation Parameters
* **NumStationsPerNode** - The number of closest stations to each detection node to use in
a grid.
* **NucleationPhases** - The one or two phases to use for nucleation in a grid,
if not present, the grid will use the DefaultNucleationPhase
	* **Phase1** - The primary nucleation phase for a grid
		* **PhaseName** - The name of the primary nucleation phase
		* **TravFile** - The path to the travel-time lookup file for the primary
    nucleation phase.

  only used in regional and local grids.

		* **TravFile** - The path to the travel-time lookup file for the secondary
    nucleation phase.
* **IncludeNetworks** - A list of network codes limit the stations available to
a grid, a station must have one of the given network codes to be used in the grid
* **IncludeSites** - A list of SCNL codes to limit the stations available to
a grid, a station must have one of the given SCNL codes to be used in the grid
* **UseOnlyTeleseismicStations** - A flag indicating that the grid should only
use stations flagged as "UseForTeleseismic" in the station list, generally used
only in global grids.
* **DepthLayers** - The list of depth layers for a grid in kilometers
* **NodeResolution** - The desired inter-node resolution (or spacing) for a grid
in kilometers.
* **SaveGrid** - A flag indicating whether to save the grid node locations to a
